# About me

My name is Lucas. I'm a mechanical engineer that has shifted careers a few times and I'm currently working with innovative software solutions at [Leap](https://github.com/leap2digital).

I have been introduced to Pascal and Delphi while I was a first year undergraduate student at [Instituto Mau√° de Tecnologia](https://maua.br), learned a bit about programming logic and  messed around with [MatLab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) in subsequent years. I stopped all programming related activities by 2013.

By 2018 I decided to get back to programming, so I took the [CS50 - Introduction to Computer Science](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) course, then I took a now defunct Microsoft course covering entry-level software development, then an also now defunct more advanced Microsoft course covering front-end web development and finally the [CS50 - Web development with Python and Javascript](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-web-programming-python-and-javascript).

Midway through the CS50 web development course I got a job at [ateliware](https://ateliware.com/) and started working as a software engineer. I learned a lot from the guys at the team we had at an innovation lab for a big bank in Brazil. 8 months or so after that experience, I moved with most of the team to Leap.

Throughout this period I have messed around and worked with quite a few technologies, most of them for the web.

I enjoy creating things, most of the stuff I build nowadays takes the form of software.
