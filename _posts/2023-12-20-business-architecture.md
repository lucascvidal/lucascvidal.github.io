We got a request for working full time with a company leading business architecture processes. I had heard the term entreprise architecture, but business architecture was a new one for me, so I did some research and wrote this post.

## Communication tool

Business architecture should be both a communication tool and analytical framework. It should be used to translate strategy into actionable initiatives.

The challenge with strategy execution is to convert strategic intent into operational changes.

A business architect should answer these questions:
- Are we doing the right things?
- Are we investing in the right areas?
- Are areas aligned with strategic goals?

## Origins

The business architecture domain of knowledge has its roots in business system planning tools used in the 1960s. This has evolved to entreprise architecture circa 1987, with TOGAF being established as the framework most accepted for mapping the 4 areas of entreprsie architecture: Business, Data, Application, Technology.

## A few more definitions

Business Architecture is a discipline with the core function of rendering the components of how an organization works to deliver a product or service to its end customer.

It provides an abstract representation of an entreprise and the business ecosystemas in which it operates.

Strategic planning address these questions:
- What to achieve
- Where to achieve it
- How to achieve it
- When will the organization know it has achieved it

Then, encompassing entreprise architecture, it covers these areas:
- Governance
- Collaboration
- Synergies
- Best practices

Encompassing business architecture:
- Organizational design (people)
- Systems architecture (process)
- Technical architecture (technology)

Capabilities are the things the entreprise must be able to do in order to fulfill its mission and deliver its strategic objectives.

Some tools used in BA:
- VPC
- BMC
- Capability Map
- Value Streams
- Value Chain (Capability Map crossed with Value Streams)

Capability maps are what the organization does to deliver value, and value streams are how the organization delivers value.
