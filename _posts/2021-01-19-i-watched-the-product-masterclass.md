I watched a few courses that made the "Product Masterclass" from Product School. The subtitle to the masterclass was "How to build digital products".

I'll post my notes and comments from the classes below. I don't expect them to be very concise and in a logical flow because I'm not writing an article, I'm really just posting the notes I took when watching every class and the comments I had popping up on my mind at the time. I'll mark the comments as _italic text._

## Product management or product marketing?

To define it, you should be able to answer the question: How will I advocate for the customer? Product Management focuses on how the customer uses the product. A product manager is responsible for defining the requirements and discovering user needs relating to how they use the product. Product Marketing focuses on external communication. A product marketer is responsible for figuring out who is your target audience and what drives them towards discovering the product.

Common for the both of them:
- Customer advocacy;
- Development of user personas and use cases;
- Both are driven by the Software Development Lifecycle;
- Both of their release cadency is governed by the development methodology;
- KPI-driven;
- Product evangelism;
- Market interaction;
- Cross-functional team leadership;
- Influencing the process without direct responsibility;
- Competitive analysis;
- Driving to product release;
- Pricing;
- Definitive source for external groups.

### Product Manager

The product manager is orbited by the product organization, user research, product marketing, engineering/quality, project management, product analytics and product design. Its day-to-day is driven by the software development lifecycle and product development methodology (mostly prioritizing backlog in agile methodologies, but also managing day-to-day tasks for engineering/testing teams and adjusting the feature set). Product management is internally oriented, focusing on product requirements development.
The documents created by a product management team are the PRDs (Product Requirements). User personas utilized in this process are focused on product features and usage development. The analytics important to product managers are focused on product usage, downloads and updates. The role of a product manager is usually clearly defined.

#### Engineering and quality

This is the team that builds the vision created by the product team.

#### Project management

Those focused on the schedule and budget.

#### Product marketing

Those who develop the communication with the client and handle product discovery and usage.

#### Product Design

Those who define how the user will interact with the product features.

#### User Research

Those who define what data should be used to back and help decision making.

#### Product Analytics

Those responsible for getting the data for user research.

### Product Marketer

The product marketer is orbited by the product organization, market research, campaigns, centers of excellence, product management, operations, analytics and creative teams. Its day-to-day is driven by the software development lifecycle and marketing events (coordination of marketing efforts). The focus of a product marketer is driving revenue to the company and its orientation to the customer occurs via the customer journey (discovery-try-use-retain-winback - the win back step might not happen if customer is retained).

The product marketing has an external focus regarding the company. It defines the communication (product's voice and technical accuracy) and strategy. The documents created by this team are the messaging briefings and go-to-market strategy. The user personas developed here are driven towards the product discovery and user retention. Product marketing analytics are focused on the customer journey and launch KPIs. The role of a product marketer is often ambiguously defined.

#### Campaigns

Campaigns drive all of the marketing happening at the team and connects the product manager to all centers of excellence.

#### Product Management

Those defining the feature set and helping marketing describe the feature in messaging (and its visuals).

#### Operations

Those who take care of the schedule, integrating product, marketing and distribution teams for the launch.

#### Creative

Those writing copy and executing the messaging.

## Defensibility 101: How to build and break software monopolies

### Why does defensibility matter?

To keep your market share & revenue _without effort and by keeping people from being able to use your solution because of the artificially high prices._

### 2 ways of being indispensable

1. Own finite resources, such as land, intellectual property and talent. _Owning land without using it to generate value doesn't make you indispensable. There should be no such thing as intellectual property because ideas are not finite. The only way you can explore an idea and not let other people explore it too is if the state punishes these other people for trying to explore it. This has very bad consequences for society and keeps a lot of people poor._
1. Operate a network that's hard to leave. Examples: Power grid, telecom, roads and social networks. _The instructor for this class has a zero-sum mindset. The key to being indispensable is being perceived as valuable to others, and it isn't clearly mentioned anywhere here._

### 3 unique things to software

1. Personalization. _Not unique_;
1. Low cost to copy; 
1. Enables faster network effects (Value perceived by users x Number of users - Allegedly software makes it happen faster because of its lower cost compared to physical products).

### How to make your software defensible

1. Bundling: Enhance a user's value perception through feature addition to an already strong product.
1. Unbundling: Extract a feature that performs better on its own from a product.

_The instructor describes a process that will eventually kill any company that acts like it. Not really something to aim for._

## Branding for builders

Branding is important because it builds trust and emotional connection between the user and the company.

As a product leader your job is to delight customers in hard to copy margin enhancing ways.

### What helps build this hard to copy way?

- Economics of scale;
- Network effects;
- Unique technology;
- Brand."

### Product skills:

- Work effectively with engineers (Technical);
- Implement a light process to deliver results (Management);
- Generate ideas that matter (Creative);
- Deliver shareholder value (Business);
- Package and position ideas (Marketing);
- Work well with design, value simplicity (Design);
- Insight via qualitative, survey, data and A/B tests (Consumer Science).

### What is a brand?

A brand is the story that builds a trusted relationship between customer and product. Brand includes positioning, benefit, personality, aspiration and emotion.

#### 2 brand models

1. Positioning - The place a brand occupies in a consumer's mind:
  1. What is it? Be highly descriptive;
  1. What are the benefits? How does it improve customers' lives?
  1. What is its personality? If we met you at a party, how would folks describe you?
1. The brand pyramid model:
  1. Product definition, benefits and personality are already clearly defined. Now add aspiration and emotion;
  1. Aspiration: The product should be still used for 10, 20 years from now. It should dent the universe;
  1. Emotion: You need emotion because that is how people will remind themselves of you.

#### Brand pyramid model

- Something bigger (How you dent the universe);
- Emotional benefits (How you make customers feel);
- Product benefits (How you improve customers lives);
- Product attributes (Features that deliver benefit).

## How to prioritize as a product manager

The product manager in any team has a goal to build the right product for the right user at the right time.

A tool used for feature prioritization is the ROI matrix.

Another tool is the feature-product fit. This tool is actually a process with 5 steps:
1. Talk to and observe users;
1. Hypothesize;
1. Analyze;
1. Learn faster;
1. Repeat.

The PM should focus on what the team can deliver and improve the process around it to ensure their time is used building stuff that adds value.

The instructor sums up the content of the class with 4 phrases:
1. Not just features but learning and time;
1. Not just customers wants but teams' needs;
1. Not just ROI matrix but work on the obvious;
1. Not just improving product but also process.

## Overcoming cognitive biases

_I believe these cognitive biases are also called mental triggers._

### Authority bias

An internal or external stakeholder, in a position of power or expertise, asserting something to be true or a course of action the correct path. Critical assessment skipped.

How to overcome? Validating his ideas in confrontation with reality, especially with data.

### Survivorship bias

Concentrating on customers most active with your product. They are likely more positive about your product or simply more vocal. They are over-represented in data (You're speaking only to part of your market).

Survivorship bias is the tendency to concentrate on the people or things that made it past some selection process.

How to overcome? Talk to not satisfied customers, to people that don't like your product. Focus not only on those who made it but on those who were left on the way. Use multiple sources of information, be clear in context of the data, ask "what if?".

### Reputation risk

Becoming personally invested in, and publicly associated with, an idea once proposed or support is communicated. Its failure is a reflection on you. Diminished risk taking and reduced objectivity. Fear and/or ego are getting in the way ("I'm never wrong").

How to overcome? Don't punish when failing and don't set arbitrary numeric goals.

### Affinity

Our customer thinks differently than us. So, why do we think they think equally?

Affinity bias is the tendency to get along with others who are like us.

How to overcome? A diverse team will suffer less from affinity bias. You should also:
- Know your customers intimately
- Never rely on your inner circles
- Engage, engage, engage, specifically in uncomfortable situations.

### Confirmation bias

We only look to data that confirms our beliefs.

Confirmation bias is the tendency to interpret new evidence as confirmation of one's existing beliefs or theories.

How to overcome? Define KPIs in advance, involve multiple stakeholders, understand statistical relevancy and seek refutation in spikes (in data plots).
