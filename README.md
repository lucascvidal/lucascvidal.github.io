# My portfolio and blog

This is the source code for my current portfolio and blog.

I'm a mechanical engineer that has gotten into software engineering and development, and I'm currently working with innovative software solutions at KPMG in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.

I like to write to organize my ideas and thoughts. The writing is done mostly in portuguese since I'm brazilian, but sometimes I write in english too.

Since I needed a place to organize all of these things, and since I also needed to make my skills and abilities publicly visible (or readable), I have decided to try the Jekyll + GitHub Pages combo to build this portfolio and blog.

## What I learned building this

- How to work with Jekyll;
- How to set up a GitHub Pages environment for site building;
- I stretched a few of the CSS muscles with some clever HTML and CSS arrangements (you should check the responsiveness of elements at the home page, there are some simple but intriguing behaviour with paragraphs and columns);
- I designed the UI in Figma before coding it;
- I overcame limitations I had neved faced in my day-to-day activities (which are way more complex than this portfolio + blog) simply because of the nature of a static web site;
- How to use GitHub Projects for project management;
- How to set up a development container based on an existing Dockerfile with VS Code.

## Have I enjoyed it?

Yes, I did. I like to work with Ruby and SCSS, and discovering a bit more of it outside of the Rails world was refreshing.
